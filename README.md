## Description

Lua magicka regeneration for all actors based on Willpower, current fatigue ratio, and optionally current magicka ratio. I intentionally omitted
using intelligence in the calculations because I wanted to keep max magicka separate from regeneration unlike in Oblivion and Skyrim. The included
plugin simply sets the fRestMagickaMult GMST to zero to prevent stacking of vanilla regeneration with the mod.

As of version 1.1.0 stunted magicka is properly accounted for and will prevent regeneration.

## Requirements

This mod uses OpenMW Lua and is incompatible with the original engine. Versions 1.1.0 and higher require an OpenMW 0.49 development build, but version
1.0.0 only requires OpenMW 0.48.
